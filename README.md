# Pong
This project uses Python and the Pygame package to create a straightforward implementation of the Pong game. Players control two paddles in this game while a ball bounces back and forth between the paddles. The goal is to keep the ball from contacting the screen's edges while maneuvering it past the other team's paddle.

# These resources were used to make this game:
-The popular code editor Visual Studio Code (VSCode) offers outstanding Python development capabilities. It is accessible at https://code.visualstudio.com/.

-Python: As was already said, the game was created using the Python programming language.

-Pygame: Pygame is a strong library that manages the game's visuals, audio, and other features.
